# GRhOOT-Ontology
GRhOOT, the German RhetOrical OnTology, is a domain ontology of rhetorical figures in the German language.
It contains the formal description of 108 rhetorical figures that exist in the German language and also shows examples for every figure.


The file competencyQuestions.py contains two competency questions to validate the ontology and to provide an example, how SPARQL queries in Python can be used to query the ontology. The competency questions are described in the paper mentioned below.
