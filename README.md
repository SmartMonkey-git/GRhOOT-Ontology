# GRhOOT-Ontology
GRhOOT, the German RhetOrical OnTology, is a domain ontology of rhetorical figures in the German language.
It contains the formal description of 108 rhetorical figures that exist in the German language and also shows examples for every figure. It is described in the file ```GRhOOT-Ontology.owl```.


The file ```competencyQuestions.py``` contains two competency questions (Q3 and Q4 from the paper mentioned below) to validate the ontology and to show an example how SPARQL can be used in Python to query the ontology.


To make the ontology accessible to a broader audience, the class names and relations were translated (see file ```GrhOOT-Ontology_English-Translation.owl```). Note that this is only a translation of the German ontology, we do not guarantee that the figures exist in the English language or have the same properties.
