# GRhOOT-Ontology
GRhOOT, the German RhetOrical OnTology, is a domain ontology of rhetorical figures in the German language.
It contains the formal description of 108 rhetorical figures that exist in the German language and also shows examples for every figure.


The file competencyQuestions.py contains two competency questions (Q3 and Q4 from the paper mentioned below) to validate the ontology and to show an example how SPARQL can be used in Python to query the ontology.

When using the ontology, please cite:
